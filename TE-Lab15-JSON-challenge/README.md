Team Edge JSON data Challenge 1
===========================

Display Dog Data using the Pokemon example


[Pokemon data: ](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=50) is used as the example. It uses [another pokemon API](https://pokeres.bastionbot.org) to get better images to display. 
It has already been stored in  file and accessed using fetch()

### Challenge ###

* Print the name of the breed as well as the image
* Try to make the images fit and not show distortion
* Don't worry about sub breeds.
* Follow the prompts in the script.js file for more support
