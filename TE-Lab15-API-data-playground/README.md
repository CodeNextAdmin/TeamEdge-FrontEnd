TE Lab 15 Challenge 2
=================
 
This file has two simple API examples to get you started.
The first one delivers a random dog using the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/). 
The second uses a text
input to search for a pokemon using the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/)

### Your tasks: ###
**Explore**
1. Explore the getDogData() and getPokemonData() functions and the console log statments
2. Copy the fetch URLs into a browser search bar and see results there
3. Experiment with modifying the URLs to get different results
4. Visit the API pages and see what other data you can get

**Build**
1. Decide what data you want to get and display
2. Use the getYourOwnData() function, which already includes a fetch() API call, to build get your data
3. Build the HTML elements you want to use to display data, including images, etc.
4. Add an HTML button element to trigger the getYourOwnData() function as an onclick attribute.
5. Use console.log to log results.
